# CSS TECHNIQUES

This is a small collection of css techniques that I find interesting and useful for possible future projects.

## Auto Fit Grid Columns

This CSS technique creates a condition where if the minimum width of a column is possible, one is created. Essentially this allows you to have a responsive multi-column section/page without needing to write a media query for layout.

## Image Overlay

This CSS technique creates an image overlay, which can mimic a filter to create a color cast, or lower contrast to make text more readable.

## Responsive Navbar

This CSS technique uses flex-box, which is a great way to create a simple responsive navigation bar with a business name on one side, and page links on another. Good for a site with a minimum number of pages.

## Hamburger Menu

This CSS technique creates a hamburger menu for mobile devices, and a full navigation menu for laptop/desktop screens. This example also notably uses JavaScript to add and remove CSS classes.

## Footer at bottom of page

This CSS technique ensures the footer section is always at the bottom of the page, even if the page content doesn't push the footer down all the way. This technique uses flex-box on the body element.
